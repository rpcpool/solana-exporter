## Prometheus Exporter for Solana

This is a Prometheus exporter for [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana) originally based
on the [Golang original](https://github.com/certusone/solana_exporter) by CertusOne but now
providing additional functionality. It is the basis for Grafana dashboards and status alerts.
