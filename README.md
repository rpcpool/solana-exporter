# Solana Rust Exporter for Prometheus

This is a complete, modular monitoring solution for Solana validator nodes and stake pools. The main
component is a [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana) metrics exporter for Prometheus
initially based on the [Golang original](https://github.com/certusone/solana_exporter) by CertusOne
but rewritten in Rust and now providing plenty of additional functionality. It is the basis for
Grafana dashboards and status alerts.
